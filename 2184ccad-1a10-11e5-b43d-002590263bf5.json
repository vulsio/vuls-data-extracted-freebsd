In these cases, an attacker\n\t    with an ability to send crafted events to any source of data for\n\t    Logstash could execute operating system commands with the\n\t    permissions of the Logstash process.</p>\n\t  <p>Deployments that do not use the zabbix or the nagios_nsca outputs\n\t    are not vulnerable and do not need to upgrade for this reason.</p>\n\t  <p>We have added this vulnerability to our CVE page and are working\n\t    on filling out the CVE.</p>\n\t  <p>We would like to thank Jan Karwowski and Danila Borisiuk for\n\t    reporting the issue and working with us on the resolution.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      ",
