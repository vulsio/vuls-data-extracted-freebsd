While investigating\n\t    this issue we also discovered that debug logging has\n\t    included this data for quite some time. Our latest releases\n\t    fix both leaks. You will want to scrub old log files if this\n\t    is of particular concern to you. This was fixed in issue\n\t    #4965</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      ",
