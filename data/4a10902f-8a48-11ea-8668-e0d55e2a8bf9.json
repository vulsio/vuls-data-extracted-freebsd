ASLR and DEP help reduce the likelyness of code execution, but may be bypassed.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t    We have not seen exploits performing code execution through these vulnerabilities</p>\n\t  <p>CVE-2019-19721 affects VLC 3.0.8 and earlier, and only reads 1 byte out of bound</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      ",
