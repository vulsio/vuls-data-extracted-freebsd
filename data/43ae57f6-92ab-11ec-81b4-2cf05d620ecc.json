				"description": "\n\t<p>The Qt Company reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/announce/2022-February/000333.html\">\n\t  <p>Recently, the Qt Project's security team was made aware of an issue regarding QProcess and determined it to be a security issue on Unix-based platforms only. We do not believe this to be a considerable risk for applications as the likelihood of it being triggered is minimal.\n</p>\n<p>Specifically, the problem is around using QProcess to start an application without having an absolute path, and as a result, it depends on it finding it in the PATH environment variable. As a result, it may be possible for an attacker to place their copy of the executable in question inside the working/current directory for the QProcess and have it invoked that instead.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      ",
