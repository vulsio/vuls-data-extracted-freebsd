This can lead to degraded performance and\n\t    eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks.</p>\n\t  <p>Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of\n\t    name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet.\n\t    Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed\n\t    packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to\n\t    avoid locking the CPU for long.</p>\n\t  <p>This change should not affect normal DNS traffic.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t",
