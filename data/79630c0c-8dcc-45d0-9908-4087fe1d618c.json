It is strongly recommended\n\t    that all running SquirrelMail prior to 1.4.4 upgrade to the\n\t    latest release.</p>\n\t  <h1>Remote File Inclusion</h1>\n\t  <p>Manoel Zaninetti reported an issue in src/webmail.php which\n\t    would allow a crafted URL to include a remote web page.\n\t    This was assigned CAN-2005-0103 by the Common\n\t    Vulnerabilities and Exposures.</p>\n\t  <h1>Cross Site Scripting Issues</h1>\n\t  <p>A possible cross site scripting issue exists in\n\t    src/webmail.php that is only accessible when the PHP\n\t    installation is running with register_globals set to On.\n\t    This issue was uncovered internally by the SquirrelMail\n\t    Development team. This isssue was assigned CAN-2005-0104 by\n\t    the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.</p>\n\t  <p>A second issue which was resolved in the 1.4.4-rc1 release\n\t    was uncovered and assigned CAN-2004-1036 by the Common\n\t    Vulnerabilities and Exposures.  This issue could allow a\n\t    remote user to send a specially crafted header and cause\n\t    execution of script (such as javascript) in the client\n\t    browser.</p>\n\t  <h1>Local File Inclusion</h1>\n\t  <p>A possible local file inclusion issue was uncovered by one\n\t    of our developers involving custom preference handlers.\n\t    This issue is only active if the PHP installation is running\n\t    with register_globals set to On.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      ",
