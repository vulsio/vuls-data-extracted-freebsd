				"description": "\n\t<p>The Xen Project reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-127.html\">\n\t  <p>XSA-77 put the majority of the domctl operations on a list\n\t    excepting them from having security advisories issued for them if\n\t    any effects their use might have could hamper security. Subsequently\n\t    some of them got declared disaggregation safe, but for a small\n\t    subset this was not really correct: Their (mis-)use may result in\n\t    host lockups.</p>\n\t  <p>As a result, the potential security benefits of toolstack\n\t    disaggregation are not always fully realised.</p>\n\t  <p>Domains deliberately given partial management control may be able\n\t    to deny service to the entire host.</p>\n\t  <p>As a result, in a system designed to enhance security by radically\n\t    disaggregating the management, the security may be reduced.  But,\n\t    the security will be no worse than a non-disaggregated design.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      ",
