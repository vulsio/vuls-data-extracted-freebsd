			"description": "\n\t<p>security@golang.org reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://go.dev/cl/576155\">\n\t  <p>An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts\n\tof header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames.\n\tMaintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS\n\tand CONTINUATION frames on a connection.  When a request's\n\theaders exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the\n\texcess headers, but they are still parsed.  This permits an attacker\n\tto cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header\n\tdata, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected.\n\tThese headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly\n\tmore expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to\n\tsend.  The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames\n\twe will process before closing a connection.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t",
