				"description": "\n\t<h1>Problem Description:</h1>\n\t<p>If an X.509 certificate has a malformed IPAddressFamily\n\textension, OpenSSL could do a one-byte buffer overread.\n\t[CVE-2017-3735]</p>\n\t<p>There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery\n\tsquaring procedure. This only affects processors that support\n\tthe BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th\n\tgeneration) and later or AMD Ryzen. [CVE-2017-3736] This\n\tbug only affects FreeBSD 11.x.</p>\n\t<h1>Impact:</h1>\n\t<p>Application using OpenSSL may display erroneous certificate\n\tin text format. [CVE-2017-3735]</p>\n\t<p>Mishandling of carry propagation will produce incorrect\n\toutput, and make it easier for a remote attacker to obtain\n\tsensitive private-key information. No EC algorithms are\n\taffected, analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and\n\tDSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to\n\tperform and are not believed likely.</p>\n\t<p>Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although\n\tvery difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce\n\tinformation about a private key may be performed offline.\n\tThe amount of resources required for such an attack would\n\tbe very significant and likely only accessible to a limited\n\tnumber of attackers. An attacker would additionally need\n\tonline access to an unpatched system using the target private\n\tkey in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private\n\tkey that is shared between multiple clients.
