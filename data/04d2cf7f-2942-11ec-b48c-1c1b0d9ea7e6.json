DBF are database files with data organized in fields. When reading DBF data the size of certain fields is not checked: the data is just copied into local variables. A carefully crafted document could overflow the allocated space, leading to the execution of arbitrary code by altering the contents of the program stack. This issue affects Apache OpenOffice up to and including version 4.1.10</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-41830\">\n\t  <p>It is possible for an attacker to manipulate signed documents and macros to appear to come from a trusted source. All versions of Apache OpenOffice up to 4.1.10 are affected. Users are advised to update to version 4.1.11. See CVE-2021-25633 for the LibreOffice advisory </p>\n\t</blockquote>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-41831\">\n\t  <p>It is possible for an attacker to manipulate the timestamp of signed documents.
