This meant that\n\t     the caller could freely control what executable was loaded by adding a\n\t     user-writable directory to PATH.</p>\n\t  <p>If seatd-launch had the SUID bit set, this could be used by a\n\t     malicious user with the ability to execute seatd-launch to mount a\n\t     privilege escalation attack to the owner of seatd-launch, which is\n\t     likely root.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      ",
