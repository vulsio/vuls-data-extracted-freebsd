These directories used the user ID for their name without additional escaping. This potentially resulted in a number of problems.</p>\n\t  <p>Autocompletion suggestions for text fields were not escaped, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability if the source for the suggestions allowed specifying text that includes HTML metacharacters like less-than and greater-than characters.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      ",
