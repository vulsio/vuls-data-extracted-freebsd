			"description": "\n\t<p>Simon G. Tatham reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-agent-fwd-overflow.html\">\n\t  <p>Many versions of PuTTY prior to 0.68 have a heap-corrupting integer\n\t    overflow bug in the ssh_agent_channel_data function which processes\n\t    messages sent by remote SSH clients to a forwarded agent connection. [...]</p>\n\t  <p>This bug is only exploitable at all if you have enabled SSH\n\t    agent forwarding, which is turned off by default. Moreover, an\n\t    attacker able to exploit this bug would have to have already be able\n\t    to connect to the Unix-domain socket representing the forwarded\n\t    agent connection. Since any attacker with that capability would\n\t    necessarily already be able to generate signatures with your agent's\n\t    stored private keys, you should in normal circumstances be defended\n\t    against this vulnerability by the same precautions you and your\n\t    operating system were already taking to prevent untrusted people\n\t    from accessing your SSH agent.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      ",
