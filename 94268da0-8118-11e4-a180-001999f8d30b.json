			"title": "asterisk -- Remote Crash Vulnerability in WebSocket Server",
			"description": "\n\t<p>The Asterisk project reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://www.asterisk.org/downloads/security-advisories\">\n\t  <p>When handling a WebSocket frame the res_http_websocket\n\t  module dynamically changes the size of the memory used\n\t  to allow the provided payload to fit. If a payload length\n\t  of zero was received the code would incorrectly attempt\n\t  to resize to zero. This operation would succeed and end\n\t  up freeing the memory but be treated as a failure. When\n\t  the session was subsequently torn down this memory would\n\t  get freed yet again causing a crash.</p>\n\t  <p>Users of the WebSocket functionality also did not take\n\t  into account that provided text frames are not guaranteed\n\t  to be NULL terminated. This has been fixed in chan_sip\n\t  and chan_pjsip in the applicable versions.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      ",
