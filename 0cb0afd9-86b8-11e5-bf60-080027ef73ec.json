			"description": "\n\t<p>Ben Harris reports:</p>\n\t<blockquote cite=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-ech-overflow.html\">\n\t  <p>Versions of PuTTY and pterm between 0.54 and 0.65 inclusive have a\n\t    potentially memory-corrupting integer overflow in the handling of\n\t    the ECH (erase characters) control sequence in the terminal\n\t    emulator.</p>\n\t  <p>To exploit a vulnerability in the terminal emulator, an attacker\n\t    must be able to insert a carefully crafted escape sequence into the\n\t    terminal stream. For a PuTTY SSH session, this must be before\n\t    encryption, so the attacker likely needs access to the server you're\n\t    connecting to. For instance, an attacker on a multi-user machine\n\t    that you connect to could trick you into running cat on a file they\n\t    control containing a malicious escape sequence. (Unix write(1) is\n\t    not a vector for this, if implemented correctly.)</p>\n\t  <p>Only PuTTY, PuTTYtel, and pterm are affected; other PuTTY tools do\n\t    not include the terminal emulator, so cannot be exploited this\n\t    way.</p>\n\t</blockquote>\n      ",
